Q: How are graceful degradation and service workers related?\
A: Service worker can be an important part of graceful degradation in web development. While web applications are designed to worked under stable internet connection, Service Worker cache can ensure the user to still be able to access the information under unstable or even no internet connection. It also allows developers to handle network fetch and request in detail and optimize user experience under unstable connection or even offline. They support the "fall back" content of a web application and can be crucial in the graceful degradation of a web application.
